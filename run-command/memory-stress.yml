#==================================================
# SSM Run Command Document:
# Defines the configuration and the steps to
# run by SSM Run Command on Ec2 Instances

  ## What does this document do?
  It runs memory stress on an instance via stress-ng tool. If stress-ng is not already installed on the instance, this SSM document will install it, unless InstallDependencies parameter is set to False.
  This SSM document supports Amazon Linux and Ubuntu operating systems only.

  ## Dependencies installed by this SSM Document
  * stress-ng
  Note: This SSM document does not uninstall dependencies once installed. If you don't want this SSM document to install any dependencies, set InstallDependencies to False and bake the dependencies into your EC2 instance. For example, by using image-builder (https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/).

  ## Input Parameters
  * DurationSeconds: (Required) The duration - in seconds - of the memory stress.
  * Workers: The number of virtual memory stressors (default: 1).
  * Percent: The percentage of virtual memory to use (required).
  * InstallDependencies: If set to True, Systems Manager installs the required dependencies on the target instances. (default: True).

    ## Parameter: InstallDependencies
    If set to True, this step installs the required dependecy via operating system's repository. It supports both
    Debian (apt) and CentOS (yum) based package managers.

    ## Parameters: DurationSeconds, Workers and Percent
    This step will run a memory stress test on the instance for the specified DurationSeconds time.
    It will start `Workers` number of workers, using `Percent` of the total available memory.

    maxAttempts: 1

      echo Finished memory stress.
